# Tic-Tac-Toe Requirements

## Game Rules
1.  **Grid**: The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2.  **Players**: There are two players, one plays with "X" and the other plays with "O".
3.  **Turns**: Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to go is usually "X".
4.  **Winning**: The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
5.  **Draw**: If all 9 squares are full and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw (tie).
