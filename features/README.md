# Features

This directory contains feature folders for each game in the Games project.

Structure:

- `features/<game-name>/` - feature folder for a specific game
- `features/skeleton/` - templates and guidance for creating new game features

Follow the process in `PM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and use the spec template when creating new games.
