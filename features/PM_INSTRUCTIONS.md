PM Lead Handoff Instructions

Goal:
Provide a complete spec package for a new game so engineering can create an implementation plan.

Required for spec package:

- `spec.md` following `features/skeleton/spec-template.md`.
- Wireframes or rough diagrams (png/pdf) showing main screens and layout.
- List of required assets and priority (art, sounds, fonts).
- Risk assessment and unknowns.
- Suggested milestones and acceptance criteria.

Process:

1. Create branch `feature/<game-name>/specs`.
2. Add `spec.md` and assets under `features/<game-name>/specs/`.
3. Open a PR against `main` (or the designated integration branch) and request review from the Project Lead.
4. After approval, merge the PR and notify the Engineering Lead to start implementation planning.

Expectations:

- Keep the spec focused; aim for a 2-week MVP.
- Identify third-party libraries or licenses needed.
- Attach any playtest notes or rules references.
